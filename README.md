# list.rs
> List files and directories

## HEY, LISTEN üßö‚Äç
This is my first ever thing in Rust and it is not optimized or tested or whatever beyond running the script with `cargo run`.

## Goal
The Goal is to have a tool similar to `ls` and `tree` - basically a mix of both.

## Why Rust? 
Why not? I haven't tried Rust yet so I thought this was a good idea.

## Known Issues
- [ ] The indention logic is still wrong

## Roadmap

### v0.0.2
- [x] default to "ls" mode (output similar to `ls -l`)
- [ ] Add depth limit
- [ ] Add limit from environment variable

## v0.0.3
- [ ] Implement colors (optional, CLI flag)
